Hi there, here is the 'Pizza Store' app you asked me to build as my Intern Hiring Assignment. I have tried to provide all the functionalities asked by you. So, let me list the requirements and functionalities for you.
The navbar on the top has sorting and fitering functionalities. You can combine any of the two filter features with any of the four sorting features. To see all the listed pizzas, click on 'All Pizzas' button, which is the default appearance.
The pizzas are listed below the navbar. All the details are mentioned. The ones with the green background are 'Veg' while the ones with the red background are 'Non-Veg'.
To add a pizza, click on 'Add' button, given on its card.
Once you click on the 'Add' Button, a pop-up will appear, where you can select the 'Size','Toppings', and 'Quantity' of your order. The default size is 'Regualar' and the default quantity is '1'.
The quantity cannot be less than 1 and more than 20.
After customizing your order, you can either add it by clicking 'Add' Button on the top of pop-up or you may cancel the pop-up and choose again.
As soon as you add one item to your cart, the 'Go To Cart, will appear on the footer, selecting which you may navigate to the 'Cart Page'.
All your orders are listed on the Cart Page. You may add more orders by returning to the 'Orders Page'.
Hope you like my work.
